# Chess
A chess game with user login, game history and simple ranking system. Match is played on the same device. At the end of game arduino board will mark it's presence, just make sure you plug one. Created with my friends for a university project. Code written in Java (using JavaFX).  
As you can guess not everything here is my work - my part will be descriped below.  
UI made in polish.

### How to run
1. Add jar files from the /lib folder as libraries.
2. Connect a database. A needed sql file named "szachy.sql" is in the main folder. Class responsible for database named "BazaDanych". If you use other tool than MySQL, want to change port etc. take a look at the fields named DB_URL, DB_USER and DB_PASSWORD.
